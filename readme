Hi!


IMPORTANT:
Data Hierarchie: 'Composition': representation of the data that will be sent to a bar.
                                the class contains a set of operations, like f.ex. 'Rshift'
                'Picture'    : a combination of compositions that will change the some bars in the room (or all)
                'Sequence'   : a list of pictures that are to be sent sequentially, like a video for the room.



NOT THAT IMPORTANT:
'Sender'
The 'Sender' can send a composition or picture to the receiver. (Later: also sequences)
Room for optimization: create a asynchron worker that checks for new pictures every 16ms. If there is one, send it.

'Palette'
Is a list contining colors. It provides procedures which create special palettes,
like f.ex. color gradients.

'Painter'
This is where the creative part happens.
This class contains methods invoking and directing shows.

'Setup' and 'LedBar' and 'Config'
Represent the phisical setup of the ledbars. Used from the painter.
'Config' should enable reusability of this program.. I shot for the stars,
but it turned out to be a little pseudo.. :P

'RgbColor'
Used before, but now Java's color seems to be quite enough.
Gonna keep it for now, just in case :)
